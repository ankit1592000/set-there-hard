    <h1><b>Why coding?</b></h1>
    <p><i>Coding is the buzz word of the present times. Be it an Engineer or a layman, everybody wants to learn to code. Now, a natural question arises that what actually is coding. The answer is "Teaching the Computer!". Yes, you read it right! It means that when we code, we are actually providing some set of instructions to the computer so that it works according to the given instructions. Now, an interesting fact is that "Everything is a number to a computer." Be it an image or some text, every single thing is interpreted as a number by the computer. So do we communicate with the computer by writing numbers? No, not at all! There are some special languages which we have to learn if we want to give instructions to our computer. C++, Java, Python are only a few examples of programming languages, but the list goes on.&nbsp;<br><br> Now surprisingly, even to a person who does not know much about programming, coding is not an alien thing. Yes accepted, that he/she might have never seen pieces of code, but certainly he/she might have worked with some or the other machine. Like, the PC itself. A PC is a combination of hardware and software which nowadays is used at a large extent by almost everybody.&nbsp;<br><br>So, the crux is that coding is everywhere. The popular social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook etc. were all built using code.Mobile phones, which have become a necessity for people in present times are built using code. So, coding has helped people develop. A message can be sent using Whatsapp in seconds. Ordering food from a restaurant is just a click away! So, why not learn coding rather than just enjoying the benefits of coding. Today, nothing is difficult to access. There are many online platforms which teach you computer programming languages and that too at reasonable prices (and sometimes free also.). Coursera, Codecademy, Udemy are some examples of these platforms (Note: There are many other online platforms like these, so do visit their websites on Google.). So, what are you waiting for? Just choose the website which suits you and start learning. Some of these platforms also provide you the certificate of completion of a course and that too from foreign universities and big companies. If you are a student, then definitely you will get benefit from these courses as in today's world coding plays an immportant role in almost every sector. You might build websites, Mobile applications etc. on your own if you learn to code. So lastly, I would say that if you are a coding enthusiast, then do not waste a single minute and start coding today. Give first priority to your main stream subjects and utilise your free time by learning coding. Hope you liked this article.<b>Happy Coding!</b>
